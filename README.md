# Patient_tracker_system
The Patient Tracker is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of patient information and medical records. The primary goal is to provide doctors with a convenient and efficient way to access and update patient records during checkups.

### Progress made ###
In Sprint 1, we identified the functional and non-functional requirements of our project, created an architecture diagram and decided on what tech stack to use. Furthermore, we created UI mockups and database schema modeling.
